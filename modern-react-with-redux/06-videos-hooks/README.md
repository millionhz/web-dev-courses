# A Very Basic YouTube Clone with React Hooks

The App uses:

- react-scripts
- prop-types
- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
- YouTube Data API

## API keys

The app requires a file named `keys.js` in the `src` folder containing Youtube Data API credentials.

`keys.js` template:
```js
export const key = 'api-key-here';
```
